    <p>You awaken to a black screen with <a href="/wikis/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/Nanako" title="Nanako" class="mw-redirect">Nanako</a> calling you down to breakfast. Reluctantly, you get out of bed and find her in the kitchen putting food-filled plates on the table. You sit down to talk and eat with her. Ask her if her dad went to work. She'll tell you that he's gone to work. </p>
    <p>Then she suggests that the two of you walk together to school, since your school is on the way to hers. </p>
    <p>When you read the Samegawa Flood Plain, Nanako will point the way to where you need to go and leave for her own school. (All of this is automated, basically; cutscene-style.) </p> 
    <p style="text-align: center"><span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img alt="" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/thumb/5/5e/2013-01-03-103537.jpg/468px-2013-01-03-103537.jpg" data-original="" width="100%" height="" data-width="468" data-height="265" _imagename="2013-01-03-103537.jpg" _imagecaption="2013-01-03-103537.jpg" class="" max-width="100%"></span></span></p> 
    <p>As you continue down the path, a cycling student will race past you and crash. You remark that it looked painful, but continue without helping so you won't be late and head for the school gate, where he'll pass you again. </p> 
    <p style="text-align: center"><span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img alt="" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/thumb/6/61/2013-01-03-103637.jpg/468px-2013-01-03-103637.jpg" data-original="" width="100%" height="" data-width="468" data-height="265" _imagename="2013-01-03-103637.jpg" _imagecaption="2013-01-03-103637.jpg" class="" max-width="100%"></span></span></p> 
    <p>As school starts, there's a large amount of idle chatter and gossip occuring. According to what you hear, you couldn't have had a worse homeroom teacher to be stuck with: Kinshiro Morooka, also known as: King Moron. </p> 
    <p style="text-align: center"><span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img alt="" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/thumb/c/c8/2013-01-03-103731.jpg/468px-2013-01-03-103731.jpg" data-original="" width="100%" height="" data-width="468" data-height="265" _imagename="2013-01-03-103731.jpg" _imagecaption="2013-01-03-103731.jpg" class="" max-width="100%"></span></span></p> 
    <p>The camera pans to a group of three students: a short-haired girl in green, a brown-haired girl in red, and a pained student with his head on the desk. These kids are Chie, Yukiko, and Yosuke, respectively. They're chatting about Morooka and the new transfer student: you. </p>
    <p>Morooka enters the room with you tailing behind. He calls the class to silence, rambles for a few minutes about hormones and baboons, then tells you to introduce yourself to the class, calling you a loser in the process. You'll be given three options to respond with: "Nice to meet you all." "..." or "...you calling me a loser?" It doesn't really matter which you choose, but <b>saying the 3rd choice ("...you calling me a loser?") will increase your Courage stat.</b> </p> 
    <p style="text-align: center"><span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img alt="" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/thumb/a/a0/2013-01-03-104026.jpg/468px-2013-01-03-104026.jpg" data-original="" width="100%" height="" data-width="468" data-height="265" _imagename="2013-01-03-104026.jpg" _imagecaption="2013-01-03-104026.jpg" class="" max-width="100%"></span></span></p> 
    <p>After Morooka exhibits his frustration, the short-haired, green-wearing girl (Chie), stands up and asks if you can sit next to her. You sit down. The gossipping continues. </p> 
    <h3 id="After_School" class="gh-sectionHeader"><a class="gh-miniButton gh-miniButtonBlack" style="float: right;" href="/wikis/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/edit/3/April_12th">Edit</a>After School<br></h3> 
    <p>(Note: While it may seem strange, students in Japan <i>really</i> do stay at school long after classes have finished for the day. Many participate in clubs, study groups, etc., but others stay simply to socialize.) </p>
    <p>Apparently classes pass by without to much of a problem, since the screen goes black, the time of day changes to <b>After School</b>, and you reappear in the classroom as the disembodied voice of the school intercom announces to the school that students are to stay in their classrooms for the time being. </p>
    <p>Sirens start blaring in the distance and several students begin to act panicky. Others go over to the window to look outside and notice how <b>foggy</b> it's become. One remarks that everytime it's rained in recent memory, there's been an onset of thick fog in the area. </p> 
    <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img alt="" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/thumb/f/ff/2013-01-03-104236.jpg/468px-2013-01-03-104236.jpg" data-original="" width="100%" height="" data-width="468" data-height="265" _imagename="2013-01-03-104236.jpg" _imagecaption="2013-01-03-104236.jpg" class="" max-width="100%"></span></span> 
    <p>(<i>As previously noted, <b>weather</b> plays an extremely important role in </i>Persona 4<i>; <b>rain and fog</b> are the two most significant aspects. Later in the game, when people begin to disppear, the characters discover the corrolation between the long periods of rain that set in after a disappearance and the creepy fog that comes immediately after, meaning that the person is dead (and that you failed to rescue them (and that the game is over for you)). So, take advantage of rainy afternoons when there aren't many Social Links available. Dive into the <b>TV world</b> in your spare time and poke around, grind a little bit. If you have no idea what that means, don't worry: we're getting there.)</i> </p>
    <p>The camera pans away from the gawking students and shows a creepy, Rumor-loving student asking Yukiko (the girl in red) about the scandalous TV reporter staying at her family's inn, <b>The Amagi Inn</b>. Yukiko plays it cool, though, and doesn't say much. </p> 
    <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img alt="" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/thumb/f/f7/2013-01-03-104257.jpg/468px-2013-01-03-104257.jpg" data-original="" width="100%" height="" data-width="468" data-height="265" _imagename="2013-01-03-104257.jpg" _imagecaption="2013-01-03-104257.jpg" class="" max-width="100%"></span></span> 
    <p>Then Chie walks over to her and they start talking about the Midnight Channel that supposedly shows you your soulmate if you watch it at midnight on a rainy day. </p>
    <p>The intercom interrupts again and announcers that there has been an incident near the school and that all students must leave and go directly home immediately. </p> 
    <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img alt="" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/thumb/3/34/2013-01-03-104349.jpg/468px-2013-01-03-104349.jpg" data-original="" width="100%" height="" data-width="468" data-height="265" _imagename="2013-01-03-104349.jpg" _imagecaption="2013-01-03-104349.jpg" class="" max-width="100%"></span></span> 
    <p>The Short-haired girl, Chie, comes up to you and ask if you want to walk with her and Yukiko. She then (finally) formally introduces herself as <a href="/wikis/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/Chie" title="Chie" class="mw-redirect">Chie Satonaka</a>, as well as <a href="/wikis/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/Yukiko" title="Yukiko" class="mw-redirect">Yukiko Amagi</a>. </p> 
    <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img alt="" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/thumb/4/4e/2013-01-03-104434.jpg/468px-2013-01-03-104434.jpg" data-original="" width="100%" height="" data-width="468" data-height="265" _imagename="2013-01-03-104434.jpg" _imagecaption="2013-01-03-104434.jpg" class="" max-width="100%"></span></span>

    <p>When given the option, respond the Chie with, "Of course," and you'll be on your way, but not before a Bleak-looking student comes up to Chie and returns her kung-fu DVD, <i>Trial of the Dragon</i> to her. As it turns out, the student (Yosuke) broke the DVD in his bike crash earlier, and Chie's not too happy: she kicks him in the "nads", and then finally the three of you leave together. </p> 
    <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img alt="" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/thumb/e/e7/2013-01-03-104531.jpg/468px-2013-01-03-104531.jpg" data-original="" width="100%" height="" data-width="468" data-height="265" _imagename="2013-01-03-104531.jpg" _imagecaption="2013-01-03-104531.jpg" class="" max-width="100%"></span></span> 
    <p>As your entourage is about to leave the school gate, a Strange student walks up to Yukiko and asks if she's available to hang-out. A few boys in the background comment on the "Amagi Challenge", and that the boy has no chance: Yukiko's never had a boyfriend before. She denies him, but not to be scared-off, the bike crash and groin kick victim (Yosuke) comes up and asks Yukiko the same question. He gets denied as well. </p>
    <p>The three of you leave school and begin a tour around the wonderfully boring town of Inaba, walking past fields and fields of rice patties. You pause and have a little chat in the middle of the road. Chie tries her hardest to ramble off what's nice about the town and finally remembers that Inaba is famous for The Amagi Inn, which Yukiko's family owns. </p> 
    <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img alt="" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/thumb/c/c9/2013-01-03-104852.jpg/468px-2013-01-03-104852.jpg" data-original="" width="100%" height="" data-width="468" data-height="265" _imagename="2013-01-03-104852.jpg" _imagecaption="2013-01-03-104852.jpg" class="" max-width="100%"></span></span>

    <p>Again, Yukiko plays it cool and humble, saying that the inn's not <i>that</i> special. Then Chie blindside's you and asks if you think Yukiko's cute. It doesn't really matter how you respond as there are no ill effects, but a good option is to say, <b>"I think so, yeah."</b> </p>
    <p>Continuing on homeward, you come across a gaggle of people all crowded around a street corner with police and crime scene tape in the distance. Someone inquires what's going on and another women remarks that something was just taken down from somewhere by the police and fire department. After a few minutes, it becomes clear that a body had been hung from an antenna. A dead body. </p> 
    <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img alt="" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/thumb/0/07/2013-01-03-105040.jpg/468px-2013-01-03-105040.jpg" data-original="" width="100%" height="" data-width="468" data-height="265" _imagename="2013-01-03-105040.jpg" _imagecaption="2013-01-03-105040.jpg" class="" max-width="100%"></span></span> 
    <p>Dojima walks over, sees you, and asks what you're doing there. Stay calm and unsuspicious by saying that, you were "just passing by" and he'll play it off and tell the three off you to go home ASAP. </p> 
    <p style="text-align: center"><span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img alt="" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/thumb/b/b3/2013-01-03-105125.jpg/468px-2013-01-03-105125.jpg" data-original="" width="100%" height="" data-width="468" data-height="265" _imagename="2013-01-03-105125.jpg" _imagecaption="2013-01-03-105125.jpg" class="" max-width="100%"></span></span></p> 
    <p>As he's finishing with you, a man runs through the scene. Dojima calls him Adachi and asks him what in the world he thinks he's doing. <a href="/wikis/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/Adachi" title="Adachi" class="mw-redirect">Tohru Adachi</a> is Dojima's ridiculous "gopher" and will play a decent part in the unfolding story. </p>
    <p>After this brief interlude, Yukiko and Chie will excuse themselves to go on home, saving their planned shopping trip for another day, leaving you on your own to choose a location and explore. </p>
    <p>Explore as you may, however, you won't be able to really interact with anything. Familiarize yourself with the different locations, and then press <b>Square</b> to leave wherever you are and go to the Dojima Residence. Go inside the house. </p> 
    <h3 id="Evening" class="gh-sectionHeader"><a class="gh-miniButton gh-miniButtonBlack" style="float: right;" href="/wikis/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/edit/4/April_12th">Edit</a>Evening<br></h3> 
    <p>There's a small automated scene during which you're sitting with Nanako at the table watching television. A news announcer comes on the screen and begins discussing the dead body found hanging from a TV antenna in Inaba, saying the deceased was identified as Mayumi Yamano, the woman involved in the affair with Taro Namatame. </p> 
    <p style="text-align: center"><span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img alt="" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/thumb/1/1b/2013-01-09-110029.jpg/468px-2013-01-09-110029.jpg" data-original="" width="100%" height="" data-width="468" data-height="265" _imagename="2013-01-09-110029.jpg" _imagecaption="2013-01-09-110029.jpg" class="" max-width="100%"></span></span></p> 
    <p>Nanako becomes clearly worried about her dad, who's leading the murder investigation. Tell her that, "<b>It'll be all right.</b>" </p> 
    <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img alt="" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/thumb/d/d0/2013-01-09-110042.jpg/468px-2013-01-09-110042.jpg" data-original="" width="100%" height="" data-width="468" data-height="265" _imagename="2013-01-09-110042.jpg" _imagecaption="2013-01-09-110042.jpg" class="" max-width="100%"></span></span> 
    <p>She'll change the channel to a Junes commercial and sing along with the theme song, as always. Tell her, "<b>You're a good singer.</b>" </p> 
    <span class="thumb tnone"><span class="thumbinner"><img alt="" src="http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-golden/thumb/5/53/2013-01-09-110130.jpg/468px-2013-01-09-110130.jpg" data-original="" width="100%" height="" data-width="468" data-height="265" _imagename="2013-01-09-110130.jpg" _imagecaption="2013-01-09-110130.jpg" class="" max-width="100%"></span></span> 
    <p>The automated scene will end. You can't do anything other than move to the stairs, go to your room and rest. </p>
