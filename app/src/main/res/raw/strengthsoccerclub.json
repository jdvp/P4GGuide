  "notes" : "It is recommended to take the Basketball Club over the Soccer club if you're going for a Max Social Link achievement, because the Basketball Club's Social Link takes fewer days to rank up. Although the chart shows that Soccer Club requires less points to rank up, there are fewer responses that give rank-up points in the Soccer Club so it end up taking more days.\n\nHowever, if you are trying to obtain all the books you have to be careful with the Basketball Clubas there are more restrictions. Therefore soccer is preferred in that case.\n\nMax Social Link Item is the Spike Brush which allows you to fuse Zaou-Gongen.",
